# How to add a challenge
NOTE: Make sure to have a consistent ChallengeName, otherwise this will not work.
1. Edit challenges.csv to add the challenge to the directory, and add the line
    ```
    ChallengeName,location_q location_r,target_q target_r
    ```
2. Under the instructions directory, create a .txt file with the title of the challenges
3. Add the robot instructions to the .txt file
