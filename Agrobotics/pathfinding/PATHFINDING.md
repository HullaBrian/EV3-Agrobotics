# Pathfinding
## Creating a New Path
### Creating the File
- Under the `paths` directory, create a .txt file with the exact name of the challenge mentioned in challenges.csv. If you do not name this file correctly, then it will not load properly into the program.
- If creating a test path, then create a .txt file in the `paths/testing` directory.

### Writing the Path
Each line will have the coordinate of the next tile seperated by one space.

Below is an example:
```
29 29
30 27
28 34
```
